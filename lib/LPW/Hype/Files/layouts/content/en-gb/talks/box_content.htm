<p>I believe we can all benefit from one another's<BR>knowledge and experience,<BR>when we knowledge-share.</p>

<p>London Perl &amp; Raku Workshop talks,<BR>
are a great way to do that!</p>

<p>You'll find the latest info on this year's talks here:<BR>
<a href="/talks">https://<wbr>www.<wbr>london<wbr>perl<wbr>workshop<wbr>.com<wbr>/talks</a><BR>
</p>

<p>You can also <a href="#contact_section"><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#327ef7;">contact us</span></a> to submit your own talk proposal.<BR>
<BR>Include in your email:<BR>
<ul>
	<li>Title</li>
	<li>Summary</li>
	<li>Duration</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>We typically have 20 minute or 40 minute slots,<BR>
and then 5 minute lightening talk slots,<BR>
and are tolerant of any variation, having already greenlit a 40-50min talk.</p>
