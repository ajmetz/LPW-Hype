<p>I believe we can all benefit from one another's knowledge and experience when we knowledge share.</p>

<p>London Perl Workshop talks are a great way to do that!</p>

<p>You'll find the latest info on this year's talks here:<BR>

Include in your email:<BR>

	<li>Duration</li>

<p>We typically have 20 minute or 40 minute slots,<BR>
and then 5 minute lightening talks,<BR>
and are tolerant of any variation, having already greenlit a 40-50min talk.</p>
