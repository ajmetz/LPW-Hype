"What's that?" asked a some-what startled reader.<BR>
"That's the sound of a barrage of super cool talks landing suddenly in time for The London Perl and Raku Workshop 2025, that is!" declared a well-hyped JJ.<BR>
"Well I never!" remarked an impressed reader.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">YAARP (Yet Another Attempt to Rewrite Perl)<BR>
<BR>
**This time it's personal.**</span><BR>
<BR>
In August 2007, Matt Trout and I spent two days discussing Yet Another
Attempt to Rewrite Perl—both the language and its runtime. One idea stood
out from everything else and lodged itself firmly in both our minds.<BR>
<BR>
After Matt's passing earlier this year, I dug through old IRC logs to find
that conversation and revisit those ideas. What I discovered surprised me:
Matt had already started building it.<BR>
<BR>
This talk explores the crazy theories, early prototypes, and wild ideas
Matt left behind—and how they could become the foundation for a future Perl.

<h2 style="font-style:italic;">Mohammad Sajid Anwar - 2022 White Camel Awardee - confirmed to be presenting...</h2>

<h3>Design Patterns in Modern Perl.</h3>

<p>This session will explore how Modern Perl frameworks, Moo, Object::Pad, the experimental feature class, along
with Class::Mite (blessed class prototype) all simplify the implementation of classic design patterns.</p>

<p>We'll move beyond traditional bless-based OOP to demonstrate cleaner, more robust ways to build objects and apply patterns such as Singleton.<BR>
Through practical code examples, you'll learn how to write more maintainable and scalable Perl applications using contemporary tools and techniques.</p>

<h3>Building the new Raku Website</h3>

<p>The new raku.org site was launched on 7th September, and is implemented 100% in Raku - combining HTMX, Pico CSS, Cro and the new Raku Air module.</p>
<p>This is a walkthrough of the architecture, with emphasis on composing clean and concise web pages in a functional coding style.</p>
<p>Will briefly show the load tests, Docker deployment and site analytics too...</p>

<h2 style="font-style:italic;">Lee Johnson confirmed to be presenting...</h2>
<p>
Two talks from the <a href="https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025" target="_blank">German Perl Workshop</a>, now shared with our UK audience...<BR>
<BR>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">1) Processor Duplication</span><BR>
Lee says: <span style="font-style:italic;">"Some of the work we've been doing to deduplicate code in a critical part of one of our production systems, and the risks therein."</span><BR>
<BR>
<span style="font-weight:bold;">2) A Whistlestop Tour of Banking Interchange Formats</span><BR>
Working on backend banking integrations for almost 20 years, Lee has been "fortunate enough" to encounter most interchange formats. Now he gives a talk about some of the history, formats commonly found in the wild, approaches to parsing/creating files/messages, and the fun/gotchas encountered around all of this.<BR>

<h2 style="font-style:italic;">Sawyer X (and the Gonzo Spirit of Gonzalo Diethelm), confirmed to be presenting...</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Probably the fastest cache in the world today</span></p>

<p>Melian is a tiny C-based cache server that doesn't pretend to be a
distributed system, a graph database, or the next big data miracle
fad. It just serves database tables at ridiculous speed and does it
obnoxiously well. We're talking sub-millisecond lookups, atomic
dataset swaps, and zero-copy I/O. Think "materialised view meets
caffeine overdose."</p>

<p>It's read-only, automatically refreshes from MySQL/MariaDB, and was
built for people who want instant lookups, not instant consistency.
Perfect for reference data, routing tables, metadata, or anything that
changes occasionally but gets read constantly.</p>

<p>Oh, and it has a Perl client, along with C, Python, Javascript, and PHP clients.</p>

<p>The talk will cover the data sets in which Melian shines (and where it
doesn't) and how to use it - including under Kubernetes, if that's
your poison.</p>

<p>Time permitting, we could go into over-slides and talk about the gory
details of how to create a cache that beats even Redis by miles and
kilometres, if used correctly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">A Slow Decent Into Madness</span></p>

<p>Paul says...<BR>
"I've been working on core language design for a few years now.<BR>
In this talk I'll take a look back at a few things we've already got,<BR>
what I'm working on now,<BR>
and finish with some discussions on where I might be aiming towards."</p>

<h2 style="font-style:italic;">Flavio S. Glock confirmed to be presenting....</h2>

<p>...a talk about <span style="font-weight:bold;">PerlOnJava: A Perl Distribution for the JVM</span>! =D.</p>

<p>PerlOnJava provides a Perl distribution designed to run natively on the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It allows Perl scripts to integrate seamlessly
with Java-based ecosystems while offering familiar tools and modules for
Perl development.</p>

<p>The JAR package features a variety of Perl modules, such as DBI (with JDBC
support) and HTTP::Tiny (with https support).</p>
