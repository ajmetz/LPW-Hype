<p>Loved Perl Weekly's kind words last week<BR>( <a href="https://perlweekly.com/archive/744.html" target="_blank">https://<wbr>perlweekly<wbr>.com/<wbr>archive/<wbr>744<wbr>.html</a> ),<BR>
and so felt I should update Perl Weekly readers and editorial staff this week (beginning 3rd November 2025) on London Perl Workshop developments.<BR>
<BR>

<h1>Update for Perl Weekly:</h1>

<h3>Your great response...</h3>
<p>I love Perl, and it's clear to me The London Perl & Raku Workshop 2025 is coming together because other people love Perl and Raku too, =).</p>

<h3>Outreach progress...</h3>
<p>Sponsorship outreach has been occurring.<BR>
So far I have contacted 10 sponsors, 4 have responded and 2 have
expressed interest in supporting this year's event.<BR>
Sponsorship outreach is continuing this week, with over 19 further
sponsors to contact.<BR>
We presently have approx. 50% of what's needed for the Trampery venue.<BR>
My hopes for the week (commencing 3rd Nov) are to continue sponsor outreach<br>
and also begin moving to speaker and attendee outreach too.</p>

<h3>Volunteers</h3>
<p>The organising team is also open to further volunteers interested in
contributing to the organisation of the event.</p>

<h3>Current State of Play</h3>
<p>Generally, this means, an event of some nature is likely to go ahead,
with a pencilled in date of the 29th of November.</p>

<p>How that's achieved, could be further sponsorship securing The
Trampery venue, or a change in venue under budget constraints.</p>

<h3>Talks / Presentations</h3>

<p>We've had interest from people as regards submitting talks. Presently,
anyone interested in giving a presentation can submit a title and
description of the talk they are proposing (enough to effectively
communicate the topic), to:<BR><BR>

</p>

<h3>Thanks!</h3>
<p>I appreciate everyone's support, in making the dream of a London Perl
Workshop 2025 begin to come true, =).</p>

<p>Yours gratefully,<BR>
Andrew Mehta.</p>
