<h2 style="padding:0px;margin-block:0px;">The Perl and Raku Foundation Supports London Perl Workshop with Gold-level Sponsorship.</h2>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:125%;">The Perl and Raku Foundation has</span> announced a £1,000 sponsorship of the upcoming London Perl and Raku Workshop,
reinforcing its ongoing commitment to supporting community-driven technical events.
The workshop, one of the longest-running grassroots Perl gatherings in the UK,
brings together developers, educators, and open-source enthusiasts for a day of talks, hands-on sessions,
and collaborative learning centered on Perl, Raku, and related technologies.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:125%;">The foundation’s contribution will</span> help cover venue expenses, accessibility measures, and attendee resources.
Organizers intend to use the support received from sponsors to keep the event free to attend,
maintaining its tradition of lowering barriers for both newcomers and experienced programmers.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:125%;">This year’s workshop is</span> expected to feature a broad program, including presentations on language internals,
modern development practices, and applied use cases within industry and research.
Community members from across Europe are anticipated to participate,
reflecting the workshop’s reputation as a focal point for Perl activity.
The workshop is scheduled for November 29, 2025, 
in the heart of London at ISH Venues, near Regent's Park.
Several speakers are already confirmed for this year's workshop,
including Stevan Little and TPRF White Camel Award winners Sawyer X and Mohammad Sajid Anwar.

</div>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:125%;">By backing</span> the event, The Perl and Raku Foundation continues its broader mission
to foster growth, education, and innovation across both language communities.
The London Perl Workshop remains one of the foundation’s key community touchpoints,
offering a collaborative space for developers to share knowledge
and help shape the future of the languages.</p>
